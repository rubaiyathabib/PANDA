				<h1 class="text-center">Collaboration for Corona Combat</h1>

				<span class="line mb-2"></span>

				<p class="pt-4">In 2020, the world was shook by the COVID-19 pandemic, the worst one in recent years. The whole world came into lockdown. Everyone was distressed and afraid of the virus. But the most vulnerable mass people of society (Rickshaw puller, CNG drivers, Street Vendors, Street children, Cleaners etc.)  were more afraid about their income source. PANDA with the collaboration of six other organizations Resilient Bangladesh, Youth for Community Aid, Project Shape Green, Road to Humanity, The Earth Society and Humanitarian Aid took the initiative of responding to the pandemic. We, together, came forward to assist the vulnerable people with food packages and make them aware to take precautions of COVID-19. We took responsibility to keep these people hunger free for a long time. <br> <br>

				<strong>Mission:</strong> <br>
				Participatory Association to Nurture Development Activities (PANDA)’s mission is the creation of future leaders to conduct activities, initiating positive social changes. PANDA trained some youths for Corona Combat as volunteers who played their role very well. They eagerly worked for the vulnerable people and conducted their mission to assist as many as possible under Collaboration for Corona Combat. <br> <br>

				<strong>Vision:</strong> <br>
				Participatory Association to Nurture Development Activities (PANDA)’s vision is “Creating an inclusive future through sustainable development”. Keeping this in mind PANDA worked for the most vulnerable people during the Pandemic. We did not only send provide assistance for them but also trained them to take precautions and stay safe during the pandemic. <br> <br>


				<strong>Actual project:</strong> <br>
				From January the world started to suffer from Covid-19, known as coronavirus. With a mortality rate of 4.46% and highly contagious nature, the virus had spread to 198 countries and territories. Then WHO declared COVID-19 as a global emergency. 
				The whole world came into lockdown. So, Participatory Association to Nurture Development Activities (PANDA) initiated Collaboration for Corona Combat with the partnership of six other organizations Resilient Bangladesh, Youth for Community Aid, Project Shape Green, Road to Humanity, The Earth Society and Humanitarian Aid. The foremost Purpose behind this collaboration was to train the most vulnerable mass people “rickshaw-pullers, street children, street vendors, cng drivers, cleaners and all the lower income people etc”. After lockdown these people were more distressed and afraid of their income source than the virus. Because the people's income is day to day. Also they were not fully aware of COVID-19 or took precautions. 
				On 19th March, the first phase of Collaborate for Corona Combat started with an awareness campaign regarding the deadly virus among the most vulnerable mass people (Rickshaw-pullers, Street children, Street vendors, CNG drivers, Cleaners etc.) of the University of Dhaka area. There we distributed free hand sanitizer and talked to people on the street about the precautions on COVID-19. Later we made 4000 hand sanitizers for the people of Shariatpur. Along with 5000 masks and 3000 gloves, these items were distributed in 3 Upazila of Shariatpur where a large number of foreign returnees were residing at the time. 
				At the end of the March we arranged food packages for the economically vulnerable families during the lockdown period. The packages were distributed to 255 families in the Mirpur DOHS area and each food package contained 2 antiseptic soap, 1kg sugar, 10kg of rice, 2kg of lentil, 2kg of potato. These families were later registered under the long term food program. We took the responsibility to keep them hunger free for at least one month during the lockdown.
				In the second phase of this project we reached 357 families of Mirpur 12 Kurmitola Camp under the sustainable food program. At the end of the April, with the financial assistance by the family member of Justice Golam Rabbani, 37 families of Khilgaon area were provided with food packages consisting 10kgs of rice, 3kgs of potatoes, 1kg pulses, 1 liter soybean oil, 1kg flour, 1kg salt, 1 box of lexus biscuit and 2 pieces of soap. In the first week of May, food packages were distributed among 70 vulnerable families from various locations of Chattogram with the help of local volunteers there. Through Collaboration for Corona Combat PANDA helped thousands of needy people. 
				On 1st April Crack platoon service was started which is a free bus service for the doctors, nurses and health workers. This service was given in three shifts all around Dhaka city. Collaboration for Corona Combat also joined with this great service as voluntary partner. It was a helpful initiative for the doctors, nurses and health workers as there were not many vehicles on streets for lockdown.<br> <br>
