				<h1 class="text-center pb-2">Project SANE</h1>

				<span class="line mb-2"></span>

				<p class="pt-4">Project SANE was PANDA’s one of the most significant attempts at breaking the societal stereotype of mental health. Bangladesh has a long running tradition of overlooking mental health, not considering it a part of health issues. Project SANE initiated a change that gave people an insight about how to deal with mental health.<br> <br>

				<strong>Mission:</strong> <br>
				Due to the nation-wide corona spread, the people of every demographic were forced to stay inside their house for months after months without any future prospects for an improved situation. People heavily suffered due to mental stress and anxiety, often depression for not being able to do anything normally anymore and the situation outside made them feel more helpless than ever. In order to help people to improve their mental condition PANDA took this initiative.<br> <br>

				<strong>Vision:</strong> <br>
				The vision for this project was to help build an improved society where people let go of their taboo against mental health problems. Breaking the barrier and coming forward to talk about their mental disruption and seeking help from others is what the PANDA team aimed to achieve here. PANDA’s initial objective was to help achieve an improved community. By addressing this problem, PANDA aimed to diminish the social barrier and include all those who suffered alone for their mental stress.<br> <br>

				<strong>Actual project:</strong> <br>
				The project ran in two segments. The first segment included consultancy from experts through online social media and the second segment included a meme competition for the public to engage and spread positivity through this competition.
				In the first segment, there were two live sessions that were hosted by PANDA and were attended by two professional experts. The first live session was about mental health in general and the second session was about career consultancy. Ms. Niger Sultana joined the ‘Project SANE: Episode 1’ and conducted the first session. She is a counselor in the Psychological Service Center of Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology, University of Dhaka. She is also a counselor in the Women Support Initiative Forum. People were given a Google form for submitting their concerns, issues and queries and since it is hard to open up to people about one’s mental health, PANDA kept the option for anonymous submission open. 
				The session on common mental health issues titled ‘Prioritizing Mental Health’ was scheduled for 26th October, 2020, Monday at 8:00 PM. In the session Ms. Nigar addressed these queries and counseled accordingly. Also a huge amount of participation could be noticed during the live session where people directly asked the question regarding their various mental issues through comments.
				The second session on the topic of career consultation on mental health perspective in order to be mentally ready for the post-pandemic situation was scheduled for 2nd November, 2020, Monday at 8:00 PM. It was ‘Project SANE: Episode 1', and the live session was titled ‘How to Build Mental Resilience & Growth Mindset’. This session will be conducted by Md. Sohan Haidear, CEO, Smartifier Academy! He is a Licensed NLP Practitioner and Soft Skills Trainer.
				Interested people were asked to submit their queries through Google form and even here they could keep their name anonymous if they wanted.
				Mr. Sohan Haidear discussed the to do’s for mental resilience and growth mindset as well as other relevant matters like productivity and time management in this pandemic period which could help keeping a sound mind, developing soft skills. He answered all the queries that participants had also gave an insight into the job world and gave basic as well as critical advice. Also people from the live session interacted well with the trainer in order to clear up their concerns through comments. 
				The last stage the project had was the meme competition. In the recent times, memes have become quite the important daily factor in everyday lives since people could easily relate to this particular form of entertainment. In order to engage people and have then spread positivity, the meme competition was launched on 4 November, 2020. Interested people submitted their original creation that promoted mental health and positive energy. The competition required people to vote for the best meme that made them smile and the memes that engaged people the most. Based on that, winners were announced later. The competition ended on 13 November with 3 winners who received prize money from 1000 taka prize pool.<br> <br>
