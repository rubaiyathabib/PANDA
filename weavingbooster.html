				<span class="line mb-2"></span>

				<p class="pt-4">Weaving Booster was a team-based training program which includes a series of workshops on Project Management. From generating an idea to initiating and completing a project with a three day team assessment process taken by an expert trainer and judge’s panel. To prepare youths for the future, to boost their abilities as a leader and team player, PANDA with the collaboration with Probritto organized Weaving Booster. The sessions were taken by experts from different backgrounds in the world of Project Management. Weaving Booster was a basic guideline to Project Management and conservation of the environment, offering expertise from experts. <br> <br>

				<strong>Mission:</strong> <br>
				Participatory Association to Nurture Development Activities (PANDA)’s mission is the creation of future leaders to conduct activities, initiating positive social changes.

				<strong>Actual project:</strong> <br>
				The Global pandemic of COVID-19 has changed our way of life now and in the future. So, PANDA knew that the new world waits for everyone and the focuses of business, organizations will be changed as well. To prepare for that life, an important part to enhance skills now would be how to initiate and run a project.
				As project management is an integral part of any business and organizational activities, changes in this section will be more critical and somewhat diplomatic to handle. To prepare youths for the future, to boost their abilities as a leader and team player, PANDA along with Probritto organized Weaving Booster, a series of workshops giving a complete guideline of Project Management from how to think about taking an idea and initiating a project keeping the context in mind to implementation of that project. To bring ideas that might one day change the world. A booster for making dreams a reality. Also, keeping a sustainable future in mind the theme of the sessions was environmental conservation. The sessions were taken by experts from different backgrounds in the world of Project Management. It was a five day session with five different experts.

Dr. Sadik Hasan associate professor, department of Public Administration in Dhaka University took the second day session on Basics of Project Management. Md. Abdul Quayyum, head of communications in UNDP, took the third day session on Project Leadership and Team Management. Md.

				All the participants joined through online. There were 20 teams (120+participants) registered for the sessions. After every session, participants had to fulfill a Google form of questionnaires based on the session. This was a way of assessing them. At the end of the sessions, every team had to submit a project ideation. All these participants had to work individually and in teams . Then after a thorough evaluation, all the participants got their certificates via email.
