						<span class="line mb-2"></span>

						<p class="pt-4">The project “Carnival of Leaders: Youth for Change” was a youth skill development project undertaken by PANDA. Under this project, PANDA conducts interactive sessions among the youth between classes 7-12 of various schools on the subject of COVID-19 Awareness, Sustainable Development Goals and Community Development. The purpose of the project is to mobilize a youth change-makers team and provide them with the support to bring about positive social change through small scale development projects undertaken by the participants themselves. PANDA is an organization dedicated to initiate green development through active participation of the future leaders. Through our project “Youth for Change”, the youth can gain comprehensive knowledge on How to achieve a sustainable society by engaging in community development. Also, amid the global emergency crisis of COVID-19, we believe the youth has to be aware of it, and through our sessions we take it as a case study and wish to create a youth response team which we believe could be the first effective step to prevent the spread of the virus.
						It was also PANDA’s first field program that focused their vision towards active green education and sustainable development. <br> <br>

						<strong>Mission:</strong> <br> 
						The project aimed to provide youth belonging to a particular age group ideas about sustainable development as well as community development. Also giving them insights about new regional, national and global issues and to have them engage in various workshops and activities so that they can be prepared for the future and use these concepts to shape a better future for themselves and others. The mission was to interact with young students from different schools in order to help them integrate in social issues for an improved understanding of their society and train them to be better and smarter. <br> <br>

						<strong>Vision: </strong> <br>
						The vision behind this project was to make young people aware of the sustainable development goals which were the main point of interest for PANDA. To build an inclusive society, PANDA initiated this project so that the under aged group can participate and acquire knowledge about community development and sustainable development goals. Through this they can offer their point of views and opinions as well as work in future while bearing the concept of sustainable development in mind is what the project was all about. <br> <br>

						<strong>Actual project:</strong> <br>
						As a part of PANDA’s youth development project  ‘Carnival on Youth for Change' , we went to New Blown School, Tongi, Gazipur on 5th March, 2020 and conducted an interactive session with the students on Sustainable Development Goals, Community Development and CoronaVirus Awareness.
						The PANDA team went together to Gazipur and held their session in the school premises of New Blown School. More than 40 students attended this session and they learned about sustainable development and related topics through various quizzes and games that attracted the students to learn about these topics. This project helped students get introduced to a futuristic education process. The students as well as the teachers learned about these new concepts which will help them integrate these concepts into their study courses which could trigger sustainable education projects.
						Also, as the corona virus was a new and recent threat to the world as well as our country, PANDA also mentioned the necessary information that they should remember and follow when it comes to how to tackle a deadly virus like that.
						The participants, both students and teachers, were amazingly responsive as they engaged with ideas on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and how to initiate small-scale development activities in communities.

						The interactive session was divided into three parts:
						<ol class="pl-3">
							<li>
								<i>COVID-19 Awareness:</i>
								A basic overview of the Corona Pandemic. This section focused on distribution of essential facts about COVID-19, spread of the virus, what to do and what not to do. The purpose of the project was to create awareness among the youth and mobilize them as a team to stay safe and keep people safe as a volunteer.
							</li>

							<li>
								<i>Sustainable Development Goals: Achieving a Sustainable Future:</i>
								This section contained a short overview on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. What they represent and how we can achieve a sustainable future.
							</li>

							<li>
								<i>Community Development: Integrating Youth on the Development Process:</i>
								The main skill development part of the project. These section was designed to train the participant youths on 3 important skills:

								<ul class="py-2 pl-5">
									<li>Community Development: How and why!</li>
									<li>Team buildup, management and leadership.</li>
									<li>Communication Management and communication breaks impact.</li>
								</ul>
								
							</li>

						</ol>

						Since it was in March of 2020, soon after Covid-19 hit Bangladesh immobilizing the future field projects and PANDA had to shift online based projects because of the situation. That is why PANDA could not go any further with this project. But with the positive feedback that was received by the PANDA team regarding the project from the participants, PANDA still wishes to further continue the project when the situation improves. <br> <br>
