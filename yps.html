				<h1 class="text-center pt-5">YPS-Young Professionals Smartification”: Partnership with Smartifier Academy</h1>

				<span class="line mb-3"></span>

				<p class="pt-4">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the young professionals and university students are spending a time full of confusion. To help them be better prepared for the future and stay motivated, Smartifier Academy launched ‘Young Professional Smartification’. It was a mammoth soft-skills training course (online) consisting of 27 topics spread across 4 levels. The program was jointly organized with SpikeStory. PANDA partnered with Smartifier Academy in this initiative.  <br> <br>

				<strong>Mission:</strong> <br>
				This project aimed at reducing career related concerns that people were experiencing during the quarantine period. Students and young professionals who were hugely affected by the lockdown period as they were unable to do anything during their quarantine at home. To provide them with productive activity and general knowledge about the employment world was the core objective of this project. <br> <br>

				<strong>Vision:</strong> <br>
				The vision behind this project was to help people who belong to the younger demographic. The project focused on soft skill development which aligned with PANDA’s original goal to encourage youth development. Although the pandemic is the main factor that triggered this project in the first place, it was an incredible alternative for PANDA to work with youth developmental activities. Even though the field works for youth development faced a roadblock, YPS was an important stepping stone for PANDA to keep up with their work through alternative meaning. <br> <br>

				<strong>Actual project:</strong> <br>
				PANDA collaborated with Smartifier Academy on their project called ”Young Professional Smartification-YPS” which is a free of cost soft-skills training course (online) consisting of 27 topics spread across 4 levels designed for young professionals or University students. The program was jointly organized with SpikeStory.
				This course package was designed for the effective growth of necessary skill sets required in our everyday businesses (Management, Communication, Time Management etc.). The recent COVID-19 pandemic is changing the world in many ways, increasing skilled workforce demand is just another change due to it. To meet up with the increasing demand during this isolation period, YPS became an effective tool to develop skills, learning directly from the experts. The topics that were discussed were “Growth mindset”, “Career Mapping”, “Personal Branding”, “CV Writing”,”Interview Tips”,”Case solving”,”Basic business intelligence”,”Business communication”,”Email Writing”, “Public speaking”,”Presentation skill”,”Time management skills”,”Teamwork”,”NLP fundamentals”,”Leadership fundamentals”,”Persuasion fundamentals”,”Negotiation fundamentals”,”How to spot lies”,”Time management for leaders”,”How to ask for promotion”,”Creativity and innovation”,”Critical thinking”,”Decision making”, “Emotional intelligence”,” Problem solving” and “Story telling”. <br>
				Each of these topics featured at least one guest lecturer of their respective caliber to attend the session and advise the young professional about that particular topic. Initially the training was supposed to last for a month but as the team went through continuous improvement and improvisation, the course lasted for almost three months. <br> <br>

						<li>Partners: 50</li>
						<li>Participants: 4300+</li>
						<li>Training Hour: 40000+</li>
